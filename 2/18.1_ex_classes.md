# Exercises - Class


1. Create a class called ToDoList

2. The class should have a name.  And a list of items.

3. You should create methods to add an item, and mark an item as done, maybe edit an item.
 - Note your menu doesn't need to be in the list.  You could just call the functions and not even bother with a menu

4. Create a method to print the list.  It should look something like
```
    Mike's to do list
    -----------------
    [ ] Pushups
    [ ] Buy dog food
    [ ] Get milk
    [x] Send a fax

```
