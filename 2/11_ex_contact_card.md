# Exercise - Contact card.

- Build a contact card for 3 people that stores information (fake info please) for someone.

Store the following data:
- name
- age
- phone
- address
- city
- state
- zip

(choose what key makes sense to you. remember, it should be unique.)

Also, whitespace is a bit more liberal for dicts.  feel free to indent some so the dict looks right
