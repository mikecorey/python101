# Exercise - Contact card.

- Build a contact card for 3 people that stores information (fake info please).

Store the following data:
- name
- age (int)
- phone (str)
- address
- city
- state
- zip (str)

(choose what key makes sense to you. remember, it should be unique.)

Also, whitespace is a bit more liberal for dicts.  feel free to indent some so the dict looks right

1. print all the people who you created contact cards for

2. print all the details of one person

3. print the number of contacts

4. verify an age is valid.
5. verify a zip is valid (zipcodes can start with 0)

6. Add a field for cars and put a car with make and model in for each person (e.g. car: {make: 'nissan', 'model': 'sentra'})

7. validate a phone number
