# Exercises - List Comprehension

1. Use list comprehension to create a list of even numbers (up to 30).  Do this two different ways!

2. Create a function that takes a list of strings.  Then using list comprehension return only the strings that start with 's'

3. Create a function that checks if a string is digits.  If it is, create a total of digits and add to it.  (you can use sum() for this.)

# Dictionary Comprehension
4. Create a dictionary containing the alphabet as keys and it's number as an offset (so a=1, b=2, etc.)

5. create a dictionary containing the alphabet and nubmer relations as above, but only keep letters with even values.
{b=2, d=4, f=6...}

# Set Comprehension

6. Create a function which takes a list of strings containing duplicates.  For every string, if it starts with an 'm' it can stay in the set.  If it does not, leave it out of the set.

[mike, matt, bill, mark, fred, fred, mark, bill, aaron] becomes {'mike', 'matt', 'mark'}
