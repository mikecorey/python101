# Group Exercise

**Split in half and work together on this.**

Our contact card app has gone viral.  Everyone really wants the ability to store a contact, and retrieve the contact.

As such, you will work as a team to build a contact card app (command line driven)

your app must allow you to 

1. List contacts
2. Add a contact
3. modify a contact
4. delete a contact
5. search for a contact (by name)

we will store this in memory for now but saving will be future work.

we want to verify that contacts can be added to the database correctly.

So we want to confirm

- state is 2 letters, 
- zipcode is 5 digits
- age is valid.  you make the call as to what that is.

Break out specific functions to specific individuals.

You should all agree on a datas structure before hand.

(A list of contacts, A dictionary of contacts?, what's in a contact? is it called state or addr_state?)

These are all decisions you'll make and agree on.

Interface should probably use `input()`.
