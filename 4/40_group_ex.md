# Group Exercise - Revenge of the Contact card revisited

Given everything we've learned in python we've seen that there's many ways to write software.  We're going to revisit the contact card.  This time our requirements are a bit more strict.

## The model

1. You will use a `class` for your contact card.
2. You will use a `class` for storing multiple contact cards called `AddressBook`.
3. You will create methods to create, read, update and delete a contact card from an address book.
4. You will create a method `validate` to validate a contact card. 
5. You will create an `export_to_csv` and `export_to_json` method
6. You will create an `import_from_csv` and `import_from_json`.

Note: this is less about menus.  So you can either `assert` or just look at your output to validate the program works correctly
