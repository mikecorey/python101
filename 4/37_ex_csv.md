1. As we've seen, csv writer mostly just cleans up our code a bit.  In fact, we could probably just write our own csv writer functions...

Write a function that acts as a csv writer, given a file name, create a function that takes a tuple or list and writes it to the file

2. Write a function that takes a file name and reads it to a tuple or list.

3. Google Colab has a popular dataset in it, california housing prices.  Open the file and calculate the median number of bedrooms in a zipcode.  Note: you'll get a weird number like 500 or so,  that's because this isn't each house it's per zip code if I recall.  You may want to use a DictReader for this.
