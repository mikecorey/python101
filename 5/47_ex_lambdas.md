# Exercise - Lambdas

1. write a lambda to take the sqrt of a number called squish

2. write a lambda that returns a random number between 1 and 6 called roll

3. map a list using your squish function from 1.

4. given a list of strings, ['123', 'abc', 'def', 456], write a lambda that filters for only digit characters and adds them

filter is a built in function and takes a function for the filter followed by a sequence

5. given a list of dictionaries which all contain the key 'age' sort the dictionaries based on the key age

sorted is a built in function that takes a sequence and has a named parameter 'key' which lets you define how you want to sort.
