# Exercise - Functions revisited

- Recall that functions are defined with `def`.
- They can take zero or more paramters as input
- They do something.
- They have a `return` or output.
- Remember, you can recursively keep calling the same function, (though you may blow out a stack if you go too deep)

## Build the following functions

1. Build a function that prints hello then a name. (use an f-string)
    "hello, mike" or something as output

2. Build a function that computes the perimeter of a square given a side

3. Build a function that takes the perimeter of a polygon of n-sides

4. Build a function that takes a list and adds the word 'hello' in between each letter

5. Build a function that computes the nth fibonacci number
1,2,3,5,8,13...  (make sure you start by testing with small numbers)

6. If you couldn't do large numbers add a list outside of already computer fib numbers to make this much faster
