# Exercise 1

Given two sides of a right triangle, compute the hypotenuse

```
a = 5
b = 12

c = ???
```

# Exercise 2

Write a program to compute the area of a circle `A = Ï€r^2` given the radius.


## Running a program
Once you've made your program run it with:

```bash
python pyth.py
```


## input()
you can get a number from the user using `input(s)` where `s` is the message prompting the user.

```python
a = input('Enter side A: ')
```

## print()
when running a program, python won't print the last result. you have to call `print(c)` to print the result.

You can also print multiple values with commas separating them.

```python
>>> print('the answer is', c)
the answer is 13.0
```
