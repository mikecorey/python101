# Exercise args


1. Create a function that joins together the strings provided by the user as input as args.  Do not take a fixed number of string.

2. Create a function that joins **four** strings.  This time, do NOT use four input variables but rather let the user provide them.  If they provide more, you only care about the first four.

3. Create a function that takes an unbound number of arguments. for each argument, if it's a string join it to the other strings, if it's a number add it to the other numbers


# kwargs

4. create a function that takes a number of keyword arguments.  For each keyword argument, if the key starts with 'r' print it.  Otherwise ignore it.

5. make a function that MUST have a keyword argument 'rate' in it.  If the argument is not supplied the program should print "rate missing".

6. write a function that takes a number of positional and keyword arguments.  For each argument print it, for each keyword argument print the key and the value.
