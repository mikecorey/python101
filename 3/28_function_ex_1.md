## Type Hints

1. write a function that will join two strings called str_join make sure to add type hints for the parameters and return

2. write a function that will join a string to a float to an int.  Call this function str_smash.  It will return a string.  use type hints

3. write a function that will accept a float or an int and a float or an int.  Then it will sum them together and return a string in the format "the answer is x" where x is the result.  Use type hints.

4. write a function that takes a list of strings and joins them.  call this str_combine.  Again, it returns a string and uses type hints.

5. write a function that takes a list of a bunch of things and joins them (any type really is fine.)  Return type is a string.
